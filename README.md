# Discord-Mangadex-Updater

">[mangadex url]" will send you a direct message on discord whenever a new chapter is released .

(Currently, it only works up until program termination, I'll add this feature later...)
(This is also overly complicated because I was dumb and didnt realize that mangadex has a "recently updated" section...)
